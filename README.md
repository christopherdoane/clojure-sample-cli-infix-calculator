# Clojure Sample CLI Infix Calculator

Just a small CLI-based infix calculator that redos input to prefix for using Clojure's built-in operators.

More like a stub to see how a small CLI-based project could look.

## Prereqs

You need to have JDK, and Leiningen installed to be able to use this project.

To get your tools set up on an Ubuntu box, you can use my quick [guide](https://gist.github.com/christopherdoane/9b62f5c40ef08d6146b64b9da009ca32).

## Usage

- Import the folder / project into IntelliJ with Cursive installed. 
- -main is located in core.clj
- Input must be space-separated.
- Exit by crashing the program with any invalid input.

Example usage:

![pic of some sample input](resources/usage.png)

This doesn't handle parentheses, PEMDAS etc.
